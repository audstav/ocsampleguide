**What is an organization and why create one?**

An organization represents a legal entity (as opposed to an individual). You'll want to create an organization on Open Collective if:
* You want to sponsor a Collective (project) in the name of your company
* You want your employees to support Collectives on your company's behalf
* You want to do bulk transfers (send money once and then distribute it to as many Collectives as you wish)
* You want to become a Fiscal Host for a Collective

**Creating an Organization**

1. If you don't have a profile already set up in Open Collective, click on the Sign In button on the top right-hand corner and then click the blue 'Join Free' link.
