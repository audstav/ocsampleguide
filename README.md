**What is an organization and why create one?**

An organization represents a legal entity (as opposed to an individual). You'll want to create an organization on Open Collective if:
* You want to sponsor a Collective as a company
* You want your employees to support Collectives on your company's behalf
* You want to do bulk transfers (send money once and then distribute it to as many Collectives as you wish)
* You want to become a Fiscal Host for a Collective
